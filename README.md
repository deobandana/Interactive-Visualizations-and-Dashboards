## My task on this assignment 

Step 1 -  By using the D3 library sample given data `samples.json`:


The  horizontal bar chart is created  with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.


Step 2 - A bubble chart is created which displays the following samples:


Use otu_ids for the x values.

Use sample_values for the y values.

Use sample_values for the marker size.

Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

Use otu_labels for the text values.


Step 3 - The sample metadata , which is an individual's demographic information is demonstrated.

Step 4 - The individual key-value pair from the metadata JSON object is demonstrate on the page .

Step 5 - After then contemporize all the plots anytime that a new sample is designated.

Step 6 - And finally, a layout of dashboard is shown as desirable.

Step 7 - The weekly washing frequency of the individual is plotted from  the Gauge Chart  https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/.

Step 8 - The example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9 is modify as needed.

Step 9 - Then the chart is updated  at any moment a new sample is selected.
